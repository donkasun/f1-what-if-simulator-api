This repository contains the backend API for the **F1 What-If Simulator**. It is a high-performance asynchronous API built with Python, FastAPI, and Pydantic, designed to serve data and run machine learning-powered simulations for its [React Frontend counterpart](https://github.com/your-username/f1-simulator-ui).

The API fetches data from the public [OpenF1 API](https://openf1.org), processes it, and runs a simulation based on user-defined strategic changes.

## ✨ Features

- **Asynchronous Performance:** Built with FastAPI and `asyncio` to handle concurrent requests efficiently without blocking
- **Data Validation:** Robust request and response validation powered by Pydantic ensures data integrity
- **Machine Learning Integration:** Loads a pre-trained `scikit-learn` model to predict lap times as the core of the simulation engine
- **Layered Architecture:** A clean, decoupled architecture (API, Service, Data Access layers) for high maintainability and testability
- **Structured Logging:** Production-ready structured logging with `structlog` for easy monitoring and debugging
- **Containerized:** Comes with a multi-stage `Dockerfile` for building lightweight, production-ready images

## 🏛️ Architecture

The API follows a strict layered architecture to ensure a clean separation of concerns:

- **API Layer (`/app/api`):** The entry point of the application. Handles HTTP requests, validates incoming data using Pydantic schemas, and delegates business logic to the service layer
- **Service Layer (`/app/services`):** Contains all the core business logic. It orchestrates the simulation process, calling the data access layer and the ML model as needed
- **Data Access Layer (`/app/external`):** A dedicated client for communicating with the external OpenF1 API. It uses an asynchronous HTTP client (`httpx`) and implements caching to reduce latency and external calls
- **Core Layer (`/app/core`):** Contains application-wide logic, such as configuration management, custom exception definitions, and logging setup

## ⚙️ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Python (v3.10 or later)
- An API client like [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) or [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) to test the endpoints

### Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/f1-simulator-api.git
   cd f1-simulator-api
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   # For Unix/macOS
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate

   # For Windows
   python -m venv venv
   .\venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables:**
   This project uses a `.env` file for configuration. Copy the example file to get started:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   
   No changes are needed in the `.env` file to run the application locally with default settings.

### Running the Development Server

To start the Uvicorn server with live reloading:

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

The API will be available at [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000).

### Interactive API Documentation

Once the server is running, you can access the interactive Swagger UI documentation generated by FastAPI by navigating to:

[http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs)

This interface allows you to explore and test all available endpoints directly from your browser.

## 🐳 Running with Docker

You can also build and run the application using Docker for a more isolated environment.

**Build the Docker image:**
```bash
docker build -t f1-simulator-api .
```

**Run the Docker container:**
```bash
docker run -p 8000:8000 --env-file .env f1-simulator-api
```

The API will be accessible at [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000).

## 🧪 Running Tests

This project uses Pytest for unit and integration testing.

**To run the entire test suite:**
```bash
pytest
```

**To get a detailed coverage report:**
```bash
pytest --cov=app
```

## 📜 Available Scripts

- `uvicorn app.main:app --reload` - Starts the development server with hot reloading
- `pytest` - Runs the test suite
- `pytest --cov=app` - Runs tests with coverage report
- `docker build -t f1-simulator-api .` - Builds the Docker image
- `docker run -p 8000:8000 --env-file .env f1-simulator-api` - Runs the Docker container
